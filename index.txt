I'll create a secure file storage service using only Node.js built-in modules (no Express or external dependencies).

Perfect! I've created a complete Secure File Storage Service using **only Node.js built-in modules** - no Express or external dependencies.

**Key Features:**
- Uses only Node.js built-in modules (http, fs, crypto, path, url, querystring)
- Traditional JavaScript syntax with `var` and regular functions
- User authentication with token-based sessions
- File upload, download, and deletion
- Custom multipart form data parser (since we can't use multer)
- Clean web interface
- Runs on localhost:3000

**Files Created:**
1. **server.js** - Complete HTTP server with manual routing and multipart parsing
2. **index.html** - Full-featured web interface (in public folder)
3. **README.md** - Comprehensive documentation

**To get started:**
Simply run:
```bash
node server.js
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser, register an account, and start uploading files!

The server implements everything from scratch including HTTP routing, request parsing, multipart form handling, and file operations - all without any external npm packages.
